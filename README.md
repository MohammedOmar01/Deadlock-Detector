# Deadlock-Detector
A program that uses the Banker's Algorithm to detect deadlock in a system with N processes and M resource types. It reads Allocation.csv, Request.csv, and Available.csv, verifies dimensions, detects deadlock, lists deadlocked processes, or prints a safe execution sequence if no deadlock is found.
